### pointnet implementation with Keras and PyTorch

**This is a school project.**

This achieves similar slightly worse result to the original paper and github project.

With the addition of an acgan model. 

Also, I built a `Separable` model, and a `Residual` version. For detailed comparison with the original [PointNet][p-net], please go to my other repo [On-3D-Classification][3d repo] for the `README.md` there.
